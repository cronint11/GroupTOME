Four software designers who really appreciate the value of beer.

## Introduction

This application was designed to make it easier to locate local breweries and local events related to Beer. It leverages serveral technologies and combines them into one site providing location, dates for events, and a graphical map for each event or brewery in the result.

## Instructions

This web application is pretty simple to use. Currently you can perform the following:

##### To Search for Breweries

Enter the name of a city you wish to search in. Select Breweries and click "I'm Thirsty" to retreive the list of local breweries in that city. To see details about the brewery, click the info icon to retrieve address and map of the place of interest. 

>*NOTE: The list is dependent on the available data from OpenBreweryDB.*

##### To Search for Local Events Related to Beer

Enter the name of a city you wish to search in. Select Events radio button and click "Where's the Fun" to retreive the list of local events that are tagged with the keyword "Beer" in that city.
To see details about the event, click the info icon to retrieve address and map of the events. Two additional links are provided (if available) providing further information and ability to purchase tickets.

>*NOTE: The list is dependent on the available data from Eventful API.*
